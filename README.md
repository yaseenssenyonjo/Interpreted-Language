Interpreted Language
====================

A library that simplifies the process of making an interpreted language in C#.

## Features

* A powerful flexible parser that utilises **statement groups** with a fluent interface making it robust.
* A lightweight interpreter that uses an **execution stack** to support the execution of dozens of syntax trees.
